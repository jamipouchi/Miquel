# Sport

I am in my prime, and I will keep on improving.

Sport is the most rewarding thing in my life. \
Last year I set goals: a sub-20 5k, and a sub-45 10k.

My goal is to bench 100kg before end-of-year and run a sub-90 half marathon next year.

Training shapes both my body and my mind.

## Past

Growing up I played tennis. I was good, competed at province level. I disliked training, but I loved competing.

When it got to either train daily or stop competing at high level; I stopped.

Since then I have barely done any sport. Two years ago I started boxing. Less than a year ago I started running consistently, boxing daily and going to the gym with a purpose.

In my first boxing fight I realized I'd lost my competitiveness. It felt bad. I was unsure if it would come back.

## Present

I hate running. I hate lifting. I dislike getting punched in the face.

I enjoy pain. It makes me feel alive, brings me down to earth.

I've mechanized my day: Wake up -> box -> work -> run -> finish work -> gym/run -> rest. I've gradually built up to it, and most weeks I end up exhausted. \
The hardest part is starting. It's easy to find excuses.

I have so much curiosity to find out how far I can push my body.

It's very rewarding to see progress. In running and lifting it's easy to measure.

I recently did another fight, and I had my competitiveness back.

My physique is improving. It makes me feel good.

## Future

I want the first sentence of this page to be true for as long as I can.

Right now I'm in a comfortable stage in my life, which makes it easy to dedicate time to sport. \
I'd like for this to be forever true, but I know me, and I'll eventually invest myself in something else. \
When that happens, I still want to push performance.

I don't know the form my schedule may have, but I will keep growing.
