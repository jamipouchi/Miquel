# Welcome

This is my personal site. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A caricature of my thoughts.

## Why

I’ve lived most of my life feeling misunderstood.

Partly because my convictions differ so much from what’s considered normal. \
Mostly because of my inability to express my understanding of the world in simple words.

Perfection has always been an inquietude within me, yet forever beyond reach. \
By definition, perfection is immutable, and I'll always grow. Still, some ideas are deeply rooted in me.

This is an attempt to understand.

## What

I intend for this website to be a dump of my brain.

Not a blog, not a collection of anecdotes. A fully-connected network of thoughts.

Each article lives on a path, making this page the root of a tree. \
To comprehend why and what is written in an article, its path and siblings matter.

This is an attempt at perfection.
