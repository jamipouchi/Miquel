# 2026

This will be the third year I set goals for myself for the year to come.

I want them to be ambitious up to the point where I can only achieve them with dedication throughout the year.

## Goals

- [ ] Bench 110kg
- [ ] Run a sub-90min half-marathon

Both goals are easy to measure and to work towards. \
Additionally, I want to invest more time in building projects and relationships.

Oh, I also won't drink alcohol.
