# Addictions

Addictions are subtle dependencies â€” not only on substances but on behavior and comfort.

Most addictions start small. A habit that provides comfort or escape gradually becomes something you can't do without. The key is recognizing these patterns early.

## Breaking Free

Breaking an addiction requires understanding what need it fulfills. Are you seeking comfort? Distraction? Connection? Once you identify the underlying need, you can find healthier ways to meet it.
